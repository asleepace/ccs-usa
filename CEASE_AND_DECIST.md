RE: Account Number(s): [ANY ACCOUNT NUMBERS THEY'VE REFERENCED]

To Whom It May Concern:

Pursuant to my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 U.S.C. ยง 1692c(c), I am writing to demand that you cease all further communication with me, except for the purposes explicitly permitted by statute.

I formally request that you:
1. Cease all telephone calls to any phone number associated with me
2. Cease all email communications
3. Communicate only via postal mail to the address listed above
4. Provide written validation of any alleged debt as required by 15 U.S.C. ยง 1692g

Please note that any further contact, except as expressly permitted by law, will constitute harassment and may subject you to liability under federal and state law.

I am keeping records of all communications, including emails from your domain(s) and automated dialing systems (noted as "osphonedialer.ccsusa.com" in your communications).

This letter is not a refusal to pay any valid debt, but a formal request that you follow federal law in any further communications.

Sincerely,
[YOUR SIGNATURE]
